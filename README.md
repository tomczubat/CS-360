# CS-360

This goal of this app is to create a mobile inventory app. It needs to connect to a database where it will store two different tables; one for usernames/passwords and the other for inventory data. It also needs a login screen and let the user login or create a new account if they do not have one. It also needs a screen for a grid that shows the inventory items. This screen must sent a notification when an item's quanity reaches 0. It also must be able to add and remove items from the inventory. Users needed to be able ot sign and or create an accont if it is there first time on the app. They need to be able to add and remove items from the inventory. Wheb approaching the development of this app, I focused on testing while writing small pieces of code. This allowed me to make sure my code was functional and caused me to have less errors to debug at the end of the development process. I had to test the inputs to make sure the app was working correctly. I had to make sure there were unique names and passwords and that the passwords were not visible when the uses were inputting them. The biggest challenge was getting the fragments to work as I wanted so I had to use the resources from the textbook to mkae sure this worked correctly on the log in and inventory screens. I believ that my login screen came out good. It was a simple and consistant design that alllowed the user to login or create a new account.
